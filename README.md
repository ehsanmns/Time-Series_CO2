<h1>Mauna Loa CO2 Dataset</h1>
<p>This repository contains the Mauna Loa CO2 dataset, which is a time series data of carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration in the atmosphere measured at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii. The dataset contains a total of 468 samples.</p>
<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
<p>The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model to predict the future CO2 concentration based on the historical data.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>To run this notebook, you will need to have Python 3.x installed along with the following libraries:</p>
<ul>
<li>NumPy</li>
<li>Pandas</li>
<li>Matplotlib</li>
<li>PyCaret</li>
<li>Statsmodels</li>
</ul>
<h2>Solution Approach</h2>
<p>We will be using Pycaret, an open-source machine learning library in Python, to solve this problem. Pycaret provides a streamlined workflow for building and deploying machine learning models, making it easy and efficient to experiment with different algorithms and hyperparameters.</p>
<p>We will start by loading the dataset into Pycaret and performing some basic exploratory data analysis to understand the characteristics of the data. Then, we will prepare the data for training by splitting it into train and test sets, and applying any necessary preprocessing steps such as scaling or imputation.</p>
<p>Next, we will train several different machine learning models using Pycaret's <code>compare_models</code> function, which automatically evaluates and compares the performance of various algorithms using cross-validation. Based on the results of this step, we will select the best-performing model and tune its hyperparameters further using Pycaret's <code>tune_model</code> function.</p>
<p>Finally, we will evaluate the performance of our final model on the test set and generate predictions for future CO2 concentrations using Pycaret's <code>predict_model</code> function.</p>
<h2>Repository Contents</h2>
<ul>
<li>mauna_loa_CO2.csv: The raw data file containing the CO2 concentration measurements.</li>
<li>mauna_loa_CO2.ipynb: A Jupyter notebook demonstrating the entire workflow for solving this problem using Pycaret.</li>
<li><a href="http://readme.md/">README.md</a>: This file.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>To use this repository, simply clone it to your local machine and run the <code>mauna_loa_CO2.ipynb</code> notebook in a Python environment with Pycaret installed.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The notebook performs various statistical tests and compares different time series models before creating an exponential smoothing model using the PyCaret time series module. The model is then used to generate predictions for the next 36 periods (i.e. 3 years). The results are displayed using various plots and figures, including a line plot of the actual and predicted values, a seasonal decomposition plot, an autocorrelation plot, and a diagnostic plot.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, this project demonstrates how to use Pycaret to solve a time series problem in machine learning. By leveraging Pycaret's streamlined workflow and built-in functionalities, we were able to quickly and efficiently build an accurate model for predicting future CO2 concentrations based on historical data.</p>
